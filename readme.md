#Blackjack!

##Description:

For this project my teammate [Elijah Allstrom-Luttrell](http://github.com/eluttrell) and I built a Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with jQuery.
This is a constant work in progress that will probably be in a constant state of change.

##Usage:

If you know the basic rules for blackjack, then it is pretty straight forward. We plan on adding more and more functionality and styling as time goes on, but for now you can place bets based on your starting wallet value of $500, then place higher or lower bets as the game progresses and your wallet value increases/decreases.

##Contributing

Mentioned above, this project was started by Keyur Patel and Elijah Allstrom-Luttrell. This is the shared version of the project but we also both run our own versions with different styles, but the functionality is more or less the same.

##History

We started the project with functions, based on TDD tests provided by our instructor. Once we had that up and running we switched gears and wrote some of our own TDD tests in jasmine and built up Objects and Methods to do what our functions had been doing previously. We then refactored the project and made it OOP based, and proceeded forward with future changes being OOP based as well. Future updates will be reflected in this readme.

##Original Project:

Started: November 1, 2016.
